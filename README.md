# Arithmetic Formatter
The Arithmetic Formatter is a Python function that takes a list of arithmetic problems and arranges them vertically and side-by-side (like we used to do in elementary school). It can optionally display the answers to the problems.

Error Handling
The Arithmetic Formatter includes some error handling. 
If any of the following conditions are met, an error message will be returned:

- If there are more than 5 problems in the list, the function will return: "Error: Too many problems."
- If any of the operands contains non-digit characters, the function will return: "Error: Numbers must only contain digits."
- If the operator is not "+" or "-", the function will return: "Error: Operator must be '+' or '-'."
